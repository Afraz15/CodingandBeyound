                                # TRIPPLE QUOTES

print('''hello
there!  this is a \ test ' statement so it's ok to skip 
reading     it ''')


# using tripple quotes will print out all the text just like that and we don't have to use escape statement...

print("hello\nthere!\tthis is a \\ test \' statement so it\'s ok to skip\nreading\tit")

# this is how the code should look like if we use escape statement instead of tripple quotes...
