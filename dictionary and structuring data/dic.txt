1. we can use dictionary to use it several times or like this...
	
print(myCat['color'])

print('my cat color is ' + myCat['color'] + ' and its pretty ' + myCat['size'] + '.')

2. we can use words, letters, numbers ( floats or simple even like this 11. ) or we can assign a variable with a number and make a dictionay word on the variable and the dictionary word can be called by calling the varaible or the value stored in the variable...

n = 12

hi = { n:'hello', 22:'none'}	because n is a variable so it is not written in ''

print(hi[n])

print(hi[12])

both prints will call the same word...

3. we can call the dictionary variables using list(name of the dictionary)...

4. to check all the values in the dic we use values and its like this...
	for v in nameofthedic.values():
		print(v)

5. to check all the items in the dic we use the same mathod as above but replace values with item...

6. to check the keys in dic we use the same as above...
