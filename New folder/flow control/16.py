                            # RANGE OF FOR LOOP
for i in range(0,10,2): # 0 is the starting point , 10 is the ending point , 2 is the interval between them
    print(i)


# there is also another example like range(5,-1,-1) in which 5 is the starting point , -1 is the ending point , -1 is the interval between them
